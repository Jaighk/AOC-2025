My solutions for Advent of Code 2025

Day 3 Part 2 is not mine. Credit to `u\mine49er` on reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1pcvaj4/2025_day_3_solutions/). I struggled with a part 2 solution for a while, and I found this solution to be so straightforward and understandable. A lesson in not overcomplicating the problem for me. 

Day 5 was another learning oppurtunity. I learned how to sort lists of lists by a specific index and some techniques on correcting overlapping ranges. Also, looking at other solutions on the subreddit, Python can be incredibly idiomatic which makes the code a little harder for me to read. I probably just need to keep reading other's code.

# Overview

My solutions for Advent of Code 2025. 

Or solutions that I learned from after attempting the day myself for quite some time. This is my first Advent of Code, and I haven't attempted any leetcode-style problems before, so I'm trying to give myself some grace. This is a learning exercise for me, not an expression of skill necessarily. 


# Day 3
Day 3 Part 2 is not mine. Credit to `u\mine49er` on reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1pcvaj4/2025_day_3_solutions/). I struggled with a part 2 solution for a while, and I found this solution to be so straightforward and understandable. A lesson in not overcomplicating the problem for me. 

Day 5 was another learning oppurtunity. I learned how to sort lists of lists by a specific index and some techniques on correcting overlapping ranges. Also, looking at other solutions on the subreddit, Python can be incredibly idiomatic which makes the code a little harder for me to read. I probably just need to keep reading other's code.

# Day 7

I had a bit of trouble wrapping my head around this one. I had a solution that would only count the left side of the graph for some reason. I had some real issues figuring that one out. 

However, I looked at several solutions in the subreddit. `u/TeachUPython`'s solution taught me about using dictionaries to dynamically store information, and introduced me to the collection.defaultdict object. This was a solution that I could wrap my head around after taking some time to understand what what going on.
